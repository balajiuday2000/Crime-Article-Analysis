(KABC) -- Authorities are trying to find a woman they believe was kidnapped following a domestic violence incident in Monrovia.Investigators are trying to find Amanda Kathleen Custer, 31, after they say they found indications she had been assaulted and then placed in the back of a car in the 600 block of Vaquero Road Monday morning.The suspect has been identified as Robert Anthony Camou, 27.Investigators say Custer and Camou had been in a tumultuous dating relationship over the last two years, one marked by multiple allegations of domestic violence.Detectives believe Custer was kidnapped in a 2017 gray Toyota Prius, California license plate 8AOR167.Officers found blood at the scene and accounts from witnesses that Custer was placed in the back of the Prius.\"Officers learned during their initial investigation this morning that there was blood at the scene,\" said Lt. Scott Hoglund with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\'s Department, which is assisting Monrovia police. \"There was also a witness account that the suspect had placed the victim under the rear cargo hatch of a 2017 gray Toyota Prius.\"There was no indication she was actively resisting while being placed in the vehicle, but investigators are continuing to treat the case as a kidnapping and not a homicide.\"It\\'s my understanding the Monrovia Police Department has handled numerous incidents involving the suspect and the victim involving domestic violence,\" Hoglund said.Custer is described as a white female, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 140 pounds, with brown hair and green eyes.Camou is described as a white male, 6 feet tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes.Anyone with information is asked to call the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\'s Department Homicide Bureau at (323)890-5500. Anonymous information can be provided to Crime Stoppers at (800)222-TIPS.'"

They say they\\'re still investigating.\"It scared me, because I did not expect anyone to be touching my thigh inside a Walmart, while I was trying to get baking goods for my children.\"In response to this story, Walmart sent us this statement: \"We care deeply about our customers and are frequently reviewing and strengthening our safety and security measures, and protocols. When made aware of this incident, our associates called police and waited with the customer until authorities arrived.\"'"
